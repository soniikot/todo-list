JavaScript Todo List
This project is a simple Todo List application built using JavaScript. 
The aim is to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and local storage management 
in JavaScript. 
As well I tried to divide the project into modules, 
so it is easy to add more functionality later and understand the project's structure.

Features
Add new tasks with descriptions and due dates.
Mark tasks as complete.
Delete tasks.
Filter tasks based on completion status.
Persist tasks using local storage.
